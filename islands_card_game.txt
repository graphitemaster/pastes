Islands
By Dale Weiler

# Deal
Each player gets eight cards. If a move cannot be played then the player picks
up one additional card. Plays go in clockwise order.

# Sea
The sea is where players play cards to make points. The sea is an 8x8 grid which
initially begins with no islands. There are three moves that can be played to
add to the sea:
    * Making an island
    * Joining an island
    * Growing an island

When a run of eight is made vertically or horizontally, the entire run is removed
from the sea.

## Making an island
Making an island can be done one of two ways:
    * Playing a run of four vertically or horizontally.
    * Playing two runs of the same in a 2x2 block.

When making an island, the island cannot end up joining another island unless
the cards that are played continue the runs of that island.

## Joining an island
When there are two islands adjacent to each other with no land between them and
the player has the correct cards to join the islands such that the runs continue,
then the islands can be joined.

## Growing an island
To grow an island a card must be played that continues the run, if in doing so
two islands get joined, the run must continue the run into the other island's run
as well, otherwise the move cannot be played.

# Scoring
For every card added to a run, the player gets a point for every card in the
run. So adding a card to a run of four scores five points, and adding another
card scores six points. Multiple cards can be played per turn.

# Tsunami
When a single player is left with no cards the entire sea is erased. This is called
a tsunami, when a player forces one that player collects the points of every card
in the sea. So if there is twelve cards for example, that player scores twelve
points.

# Winner
The winner is determined by the first person to have 500 points or more after
forcing a tsunami.
